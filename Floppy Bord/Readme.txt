A small project to learn how horizontal fine scrolling can be done.

License:
========
I don't have the slightest clue yet. Which one should I use?
For a start, please, follow these simple rules:

- 	You can copy the binary's as often as you wish, but, always include this file 		(Readme.txt) with your copy.

-	You may change the source file and are encouraged to do so. But, please, document 	your changes and always leave the original authors name (RetroZock) on the title 	screen. 

The home directory contains the following files and sub directories:
====================================================================

- 	Readme.txt		
	That's what you are reading

- 	Floppy_File.ATR			
	Atari Disk Image containing DOS 2.5 + DUP and "Floppy.obj"
	Atari DOS compatible binary file => File version of Floppy.
	Boot with Basic off. From the DUP Menu use the "L" command to load
	Floppy.obj and the "M" command to start from address $afc8

-	FLoppy Bord.asm
	Source Code, a plain text file

-	Floppy Bord.xex
	Raw binary that can be run by most Atari emulators. Just double click or
	drag and drop it on your emulator icon.
	(Tested on: ATARI800MacX // V2.2)

Sub Directorys:

- 	Older Versions
	Milestones, different "experiments" during the developement pause. 
	Not maintained or docunented. 

- 	Doc
	Some "Production Notes".

- 	Fonts
	Some Atari 8- Bit fonts I have used.
